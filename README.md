# Learning and Development: Logistic Regression Analysis: Rain Tomorrow in Australia

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with logistic regression analysis performed on the "Rain Tomorrow in Australia" dataset from Kaggle. The analysis aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in various locations across Australia based on several weather-related features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is "Rain Tomorrow in Australia," which contains weather observations from numerous weather stations across Australia. It includes features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall, among others. The target variable is whether it will rain tomorrow, represented as a binary outcome (yes/no).
